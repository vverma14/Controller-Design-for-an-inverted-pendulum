# Controller-Design-for-an-inverted-pendulum
This is a project at ASU. I desinged Proportional-Interal-Derivative controller(PID) and a Linear-Quadratic-Regulator(LQR) to stabilize an unstable system, i.e an inverted pendulum. 
P.S : I'm still trying to find the code for this project. No luck yet! Till then the report should be a good read since it covers most of the things anyway.
